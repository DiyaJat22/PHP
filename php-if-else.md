## âœ… What is `if...else` in PHP?

The `if...else` statement allows you to **execute one block of code if a condition is true**, and another block **if the condition is false**.

## ðŸ”¹ Syntax:

```php
if (condition) {
    // code to run if condition is true
} else {
    // code to run if condition is false
}

```

} else {
    echo "You are a minor.";
}
?>

```

**Output:**

```
You are a minor.

```
